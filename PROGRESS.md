# TinCan Project Progress & Future Tasks

## Current Status

TinCan is a CLI tool for transferring files between machines using Amazon S3 as intermediary storage. The application is built in Go using the Cobra CLI framework and AWS SDK v2.

### Completed Features âœ…

- **Core CLI Structure**: Built with Cobra framework
- **S3 Integration**: AWS SDK v2 implementation
- **Configuration Management**: Viper-based config with env vars and YAML support
- **Basic Commands**:
  - `upload`: Upload files to S3
  - `download`: Download files from S3
  - `list`: List available files
  - `clean`: Clean up files
  - `version`: Display version information
- **Build System**: Makefile with cross-platform builds and version injection
- **Web Interface**: Added web interface functionality
- **Embedded API Keys**: Support for building with embedded API keys
- **Versioning**: Version 1.0.0 with build-time injection of version, git commit, and build date
